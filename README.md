Red team attack 101

All of this should that under 10 min

Apple pay via iphone 

1 social engineering- need to spy on devices passcode - doesn't need to by spy put just have to figure it out - ex- if your using their phone their to bring the shutdown message then lock the screen and it will require to for passcode from their you can either give to phone to them to unlock it or ask for the passcode


2 depending on the situation, you will take different actions - if they left their phone near you and went to do something ( like use the bathroom) you will read their card and it will ask for face id - to bypass that you can chose to enter the devices passcode 

Make sure to if the device gets any notification you clear it so it does seem like they spend nothing. 



All in one Attack -
Now on this one spying on passcode is optional ( and preferred ) or you can do a brute force attack.


You will be stealing their phone if you have the passcode you will unlock it*- if not then brute force attack. After that you will login to their bank account ( check note for login stuff) then you will factory reset the phone and sell the phone for 50% of the value on facebook so someone buys it fast and quick.

*When you log in make sure to change their icloud passcode so they canâ€™t track you down.
